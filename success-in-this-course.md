# How to be Successful in this course

> The beginning of knowledge is the intention, then listening, then understanding, then action, then preservation, and then spreading it.

> Ibn al-Mubarak

How can we utilize what Ibn al-Mubarak says in order to supercharge our learning process. We will break them down into the following principles to accommodate to our current situation.

1.  **Intention**
2. **Listening** (For us this means **Learning**: reading books, tutorials, video lectures, seminars and so on )
3. **Understanding**
4. **Action** (For us, this means **practice** and **built** things) 
5. **Preservation** 
6. **Spreading** 

> When you make a sincere intention to stand on principles, Allah SWT will help you.

## First principle - Intention

The first principle, the beginning of knowledge is intention. why are you seeking it? For this, set your intention and goals higher than just getting a job or make money, those will come by default when you set your intention higher.

## Second principle - Learning

In this course the goal is to strive for mastery, but mastery is a slow painstaking process, you have to keep at it everyday. This is where learning starts. If you don't have daily learning goals, you qualify as a dreamer. It is okay to dream, provided that, you adapt principles to learn daily towards realizing your goals.

You should set aside at least three hours everyday for learning and practicing, just make sure to be in an environment that is free of distraction. **Focus** is paramount in learning. Don't forget to take breaks in between.

Sometimes, we feel like we don't want to learn anymore. When this happens, take a break (15 minutes or more), seek refuge in Allah from the devil (shaytan) and get back to it.

Remember, learning daily yields a better results than forcing  a lot of hours a day every week. This process is a day by day thing, consistency is  the key to becoming a good developer. Not tomorrow, not next week, not next month but today and everyday.

## Third principle - Understanding 

Up next, you strive for understanding. Make sure you understand a lesson (or even a section of the lesson) before you move on to the next lesson or section. If you do not understand, first try to read the lesson or section again; alternatively you can ask  questions in the Slack/Whats App group if you donâ€™t understand something or if you get stuck.  

Go through the fundamentals slowly to build a solid foundation, this will help when you start working on projects.

**Do not move on until you understand.** If you do not understand, you won't be able to learn the next lesson well.

The next day, summarize what you've learned yesterday before learning  the next lesson. This process helps to reinforce the lesson deeper into your  brain.

## Fourth principle - Practicing 

Practice, practice and practice daily. There is absolutely no substitute for practice in learning web development. The reading alone is not going to make you a developer, only putting those theory into practice will solidify your knowledge. 

Apart from your daily practice, may be on a weekly bases or so, try improving your analytical problem solving skills with code  (taking a new problem with material you haven't seen before and navigating through it). When working on a problem, first write down the steps you need to do to solved the problem. If you don't know what to write, that's okay. Just write anything that comes to your mind.

## Fifth principle - Preservation

When you complete a lesson or module, preserve what you learn by taken notes (write down what you have learned in your own words) and also committing it to GitHub.  Writing gives you more clarity, and helps you retain the topic or lesson for a longer period.

Get a manuscript book for taking notes.

## Sixth principle - Spreading

Teach others what you have learned. 

Every week, we will have stand-ups before class and everyone will take 3 - 5 mins to share with us what you have learn for the past week.


## Finally - The secrete ingredient 

This is put last so that you will not forget, otherwise it would have been the first one on top

Ibn al-Mubarak said, "I studied *adab* (manners) for thirty years and I studied knowledge for twenty years." Knowledge has no value without sincerity and good conduct.

> One of these will be true, you will **make excuses** or **quit** or **become successful**
