## Walk-throughs

Integrated into projects are 'walk-throughs' videos that offer direction on where to begin and how to approach project/s.

## Solutions

Available after projects' deadlines are Solutions, which Ebrima Touray will explore actual solutions to projects. You are expected to be in class for insights into how else you could have (or should have!) implemented your own solutions.

## Final Project

All final projects will solve an actual problem, that have an impact in our community. Each team will strive to create something that outlives this course.

Development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one of your classmates for this final project.

Guidelines for the final project will be release towards the end of the course.
