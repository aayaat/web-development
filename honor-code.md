# Honor Code

This a document is for all my courses here at MDI.

- Web Programming I and II 
- Database I and II

## Rationale

Our country will not grow intellectually, if we lower the **quality of education** and **allow cheating** in our all forms of assessments (Test, Exams etc) and projects. If it is not your work, please give credit where it is due.

## Terms and Conditions

The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on projects is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you or giving you a copy of his work. 

Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy. 

Collaboration on test and exam is not permitted at all. Collaboration on the course's final project is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specification.

If anyone goes beyond the terms stated in this policy on any of the projects, exam and test, both of you will get zero for that item, regard less of who copied who.

If you agree to this, please put your name and signature below. After signing your name, please submit this document to the lecturer.
