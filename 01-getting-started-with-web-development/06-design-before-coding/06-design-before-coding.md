# Design before coding



Design before coding discusses the planning and  design work you have to do for your web page or website before writing code.

## First things first: planning

Before doing anything, you need some ideas. What should your website  actually do? A website can do basically anything, but, for your first  try, you should keep things simple. 

To begin, you'll need to answer these questions:

1. **What is your website about?** 
2. **What information are you presenting on the subject?** Write a title and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
3. **What does your website look like,** in simple  high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is  appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?



We'll start by creating a simple **profile page** with a heading, an image, a paragraph and a link.

## Sketching out your design
