# Dealing with files

A website or web page consists of many files (html files, css files, js files, images, videos, fonts and so on) depending on the scale of the project. You want to make sure all those files are at a closer reach for you to be able to reference them easily. 

Each practice or project, whether small or big, you should have the habit of keeping all related files in a single folder. The name of the folder should be related to the practice or project. 

## On case sensitive and spacing

Some important rules to adhere to when naming folders and files.

- All files and folder names must be in lower case. 
- If a file or folder name has more than one word, you separate the words with a hyphen (dash) example **my-profile**

This is because:

- Many computers, particularly web servers, are case-sensitive.
- Browsers, web servers, and programming languages do not handle spaces consistently. 

## Where to keep our projects

Now, the questions you might asked, where should all these folders be? That entirely depends on you. 

You can create a master folder called `web-projects` anywhere in your computer that will house all the practices and projects you will do in this course. Maybe in your Home folder or Documents folder.

**Action**: Create a master folder called **web-projects** in your Documents or Home folder.

Note: Use this folder to store all your future practices and projects for this course.

## What structure should a project have

For now, we will keep it simple since we are first leaning HTML and CSS. 

The project structure can vary depending on the project or team you are working with.

A common thing is to separation the technologies and files involved in a logical structure. 

The most common thing is to:

- have all HTML file(s) in the root folder of the project, 
- create a folder to contain the CSS file(s) called **css**
- create a folder to contain the JavaScript file(s) called **js**
- create a folder to contain the Images(s) called **images**
- ...

## Coding state

As far as coding is concern, we need three instances for now:

- A text editor (for writing code)
- The explorer (where the file and folders we are working get stored) and  
- A browser (for viewing code)

## Activity

Letâ€™s do an activity by working on a project called **welcome**

Assuming you have already created the master folder (**web-projects**)  to keep all the practices and projects. If you haven't do it now, I will wait. 

Having that done, let's move on and do the following:

1. Open the **web-projects** folder you created earlier or just recently.

2. Inside the web-projects folder, create a new folder called **welcome**

3. Now we will open this folder in VS Code, there are two ways:

   1. Have the window explorer and VS Code open side by side, then click on the welcome folder and drag it into VS Code. 

   2. Alternatively, You can also open the welcome folder via VS Code

      In VS Code, click **File** --> **Open Folder...** a pop-up window will appear. Next, locate the welcome folder we created in the master web-projects folder and single click on it, then click on **select folder** or **open**

If all goes well, you should see the welcome folder in caps on the VS Code. 

In the next section  we will learn how to create a starter boilerplate with all the necessary file/s and sub folder/s for each project.
