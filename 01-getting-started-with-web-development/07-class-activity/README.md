# Class Activity - A profile Page

In this activity, we are going to build a profile page. This way, we can put into practice what we have learned so far.

Consider the final output of what we will be coding below

Let's get started:

1. Open the master folder we created earlier
2. copy and and paste the **starter-boilerplate** we created earlier. You will see that a copy of the starter-boilerplate is created
3. Now rename the copy of the starter-boilerplate to **my-profile**
4. Open my-profile via VS Code
5. In the index.html file, update the title content to **My personal profile page**
6. By looking at the design above code it using the right elements

## Assets

The material/s (the profile image) needed for this task are in the assets found within this folder.

- Copy the profile image from the assets folder and paste it into your images folder in my-profile folder.
