## Web Development

Web development is the art of creating a **Website** or **Web Application** so that a user can interact with it.

Web development is divided into two categories, **Front-end web development** (aka client-side development) and **Back-end web development** (aka server-side development).

### Who is a web developer (web programmer)

**A web developer** is someone who develops websites and/or web applications;

**A front-end developer** does this using web technologies (i.e., [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)), which typically runs on the [Open Web Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform) or acts as compilation input for non-web platform environments (i.e., [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)).

**A back-end developer** does this using web technologies (i.e. NodeJs, Python, PHP, etc), which typically runs on a server.

**Full Stack developer** :: This is where a developers marry both sides into one. A Full Stack developer can comfortably work with both the front and back ends.

### The objective of a web developer

The objective of developing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

## HTML, CSS & JavaScript

These three technologies (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) are the basic building blocks of the web. Technically, they are different in terms of design and purpose. But at the end of the day, you can put all of them together to build a website or a web Application.

Consider the following designs built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Design 1 A profile page - HTML and CSS only**
